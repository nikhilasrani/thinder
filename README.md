Solve indecision in deciding a restaurant using this game-ified selection approach in this React Native App.

## Built With

* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - Framework for building native apps using React.
* [Expo](https://expo.io/) - Open Source toolchain built around React Native to make development easier.
* [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) - Used their beautiful open source Illustrations.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the Expo app installed on your phone in order to be able to run the application natively.
You can also use the iOS or Android simulators if you want to. 


## Installation

Run the npm install command to install the development tools and prerequisite dependencies and node modules.

```
npm install
```

## Running the Application

After installation, you can run the application using npm start or expo start
```
npm start
```
```
expo start
```

## Building the Application (to make .ipa or .apk files)
Since this application is using an Expo managed workflow, 
Expo handles the build process and provides you with the required files for whichever platform.

```
expo build:android
```
```
expo build:ios
```
